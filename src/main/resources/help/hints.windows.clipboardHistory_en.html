<h1>Windows Clipboard History</h1>
<h2>What does this feature?</h2>
<p>The Windows Clipboard History feature saves everything you store in your clipboard so that you can access it
    later.</p>
<br>
<h2>Why does this feature endanger your use of PassVault?</h2>
<p>Well, if you use the feature to copy a stored password in order to paste it to e.g. a login form,
    Windows will store the password via the Clipboard History feature and later, someone else who uses your pc can
    access it.</p>
<br>
<h2>Is this feature enabled on my PC?</h2>
<p>To check whether you have the Clipboard History feature enabled or not press: Win(dows key) + V.
    If a dialog appears that either says the clipboard is empty or shows you items you have recently copied, the feature
    is enabled.
    If the feature is disabled, the dialog asks you to turn on the feature, or it doesn't even show up. </p>
<br>
<h2>How to disable?</h2>
<p>If you want to disable the feature, follow the instructions in this video:</p>
